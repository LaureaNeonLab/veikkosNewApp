    The above statment means we will serve our app in the chrome browser.
    With the browser active press Ctrl+Shift+i (on Mac/Linux open the menu and start developer tools.)

      The ng-app is used for creating a link to the AngularJs code that will act as the backbone of your application.
      These covers things like Navigation and Routing which can be explained in the tutorials in these links:
      - http://www.w3schools.com/angular/ (Great intro to the ideals of Angular with examples.)
      - http://campus.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js/intro 
      (This uses HTML5 instead of Ionic tags but they are interchangeable).
      - Also try delete the ng-app="start" and see what happens, then undo it

          most if not all tags that are native to ionic have the keyword ion- preceding the statement.
          for example the below statement ion-header-bar means a container at the top.
          the class of this header bar denotes the style of the bar.
          
          Ionic has many pre defined styles
